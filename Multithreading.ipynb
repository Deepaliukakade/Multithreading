    "#Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "'''Multithreading in Python\n",
    "Multithreading in Python is a feature that allows your program to execute multiple threads or flows of execution concurrently. \n",
    "Each thread can perform a specific task, and they can run in parallel, improving the overall performance and responsiveness of your program.\n",
    "#Why Multithreading is Used\n",
    "Multithreading is used for several reasons:\n",
    "Concurrency: Multithreading allows your program to perform multiple tasks concurrently, improving responsiveness and throughput.\n",
    "Improved System Utilization: By utilizing multiple CPU cores, multithreading can improve system utilization and reduce idle time.\n",
    "Asynchronous Programming: Multithreading enables asynchronous programming, where tasks can run in the background while the main program continues to \n",
    "execute.\n",
    "#Module Used to Handle Threads in Python\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is called _thread (low-level) or threading (high-level). The threading module is more commonly used and \n",
    "provides a higher-level interface for working with threads.\n",
    "The threading module provides several benefits, including:\n",
    "Thread Objects: You can create thread objects that can be started, joined, and managed.\n",
    "Locks and Synchronization: The module provides locks and synchronization primitives to help you manage shared resources and avoid thread-related issues.\n",
    "Thread-Safe Data Structures: Some data structures in the threading module are thread-safe, making it easier to share data between threads.'''"
